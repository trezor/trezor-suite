# Out of the blue, we started to run into CI failures. All of them had one thing in common. 
# Some of our dependencies postinstall scripts tried to execute a binary in ./node_modules/.bin/
# that was not available at the moment. This happens probably because of the async manner in which
# base packages are downloaded and installed in concurrence with the fact that the troublesome 
# package relies on existence of another package already installed.
# as a quick fix, create a project and install needed packages to provide yarn cache on image level.
