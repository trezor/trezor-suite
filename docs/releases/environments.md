# Environments

## Staging

Staging is available at staging-suite.trezor.io and is only accessible within SatoshiLabs internal IP range (office + VPN).

Before releasing publicly we deploy to so-called staging environment which should be 1:1 with production. QA tests the release there.

## Production (suite.trezor.io)

Stable version is hosted on suite.trezor.io.
