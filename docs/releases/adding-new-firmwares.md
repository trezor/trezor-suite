# Adding New Firmwares

In case we are about to release both Suite and firmwares we want to add the signed binaries during the Freeze so QA has the whole thing to test.

Binaries and release definitions are stored in `packages/connect-common/files/firmware/*` in the same folder structure as they are in [https://github.com/trezor/webwallet-data](https://github.com/trezor/webwallet-data) deployed on [https://data.trezor.io](https://data.trezor.io).

Latest and intermediary firmware binaries are bundled in `suite-desktop` and `suite-web` so the whole onboarding process in desktop app – including FW installation – can be completed offline. It means that only the latest and intermediary Firmware binaries are currently available in Suite (both web and desktop). There is no fallback on [https://data.trezor.io](https://data.trezor.io).

Package `@trezor/connect-common` is a public NPM package used as dependency of `@trezor/connect`.

## Add firmwares

1. Complete the firmware release process including firmware signing.

1. Add firmwares to `packages/connect-common/files/firmware/*` and modify its `releases.json` file. See [Firmware `releases.json` files structure](#firmware-releasesjson-files-structure) for an explanation and [90bb548](https://github.com/trezor/trezor-suite/commit/90bb548aec06c9b4816c9a87b2ffa5fcade99f29) for an example.

1. Remove older binaries so they are not bundled in the desktop app any more, but always keep:

    - the intermediary FW for Trezor One [packages/connect-common/files/firmware/1/trezor-inter-1.10.0.bin](https://github.com/trezor/trezor-suite/blob/develop/packages/connect-common/files/firmware/1/trezor-inter-1.10.0.bin)
    - and 2.1.1 for model T [packages/connect-common/files/firmware/2/trezor-2.1.1.bin](https://github.com/trezor/trezor-suite/blob/develop/packages/connect-common/files/firmware/2/trezor-2.1.1.bin)

    See [#4262](https://github.com/trezor/trezor-suite/issues/4262) for explanation.

1. Test it locally (at least by running `yarn build:libs` to rebuild connect files and `yarn suite:dev` to use/copy them).

1. Freeze Suite. At this moment you are all good to _Freeze_ and forward to QA. They should be able to test Suite in its wholeness along with the new firmwares.

## Release for 3rd party users of @trezor/connect

After Suite is released, distribute new firmware by releasing new `@trezor/connect` with an updated `@trezor/connect-common` package.

[Follow instructions](../packages/connect/deployment.md) on how to release a new version of `@trezor/connect`.

### Firmware `releases.json` files structure

Firmware `releases.json` files provide data about all available firmware versions and they are used to offer the correct firmware version for the user to update depending on the current version of firmware, bootloader and bridge. See the table below for a description of every param.

Those `releases.json` files are bundled inside `@trezor/connect` in `/static/connect/data` folder. Therefore, `suite-web` takes if from [`https://suite.trezor.io/web/static/connect/data/firmware/{1|2}/releases.json?r={timestamp to prevent caching}`](https://suite.trezor.io/web/static/connect/data/firmware/1/releases.json?r=1654786865680) and `suite-desktop` has it on `file:///static/connect/data/firmware/{1|2}/releases.json`. Neither the `suite-web` nor the `suite-desktop` take it from [https://data.trezor.io](https://data.trezor.io).
