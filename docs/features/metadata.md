# Metadata (labeling)

Metadata is a feature which allows user to associate persistent data with their accounts, transactions, addresses or even hidden wallets.
Trezor Suite refers to metadata as to "labeling" in user interface.

## Data stores

Because Trezor Suite is not a typical application with a backend server, data must be stored elsewhere. Currently supported providers are:

-   Dropbox
-   Google Drive

Planned to be supported in future:

-   Local file system (desktop only)
-   SD card

## Data structure in store

### version 1.0.0 (current)

device metadata example

```javascript
{
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "walletLabel": "my hidden wallet label",
},
```

account metadata example

```javascript
{
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "accountLabel": "my cool account label",
  "outputLabels": {
    "9f472739fa7034dfb9736fa4d98915f2e8ddf70a86ee5e0a9ac0634f8c1d0007": {
      "0": "transaction 1"
    },
  },
  "addressLabels": {
    "bc1qannfxke2tfd4l7vhepehpvt05y83v3qsf6nfkk": "my cool address label",
  }
}
```

### version 2.0.0 (future)

Each record will have timestamp which will allow user to resolve potential conflicts

## Data encryption

Data is stored in encrypted form using aes-256-gcm cipher.
Master key for encryption is generated by users Trezor with constants defined in
[suite/src/actions/suite/constants/metadataConstants.ts](../src/actions/suite/constants/metadataConstants.ts#L18)
Files encryption-decryption logic is located in
[suite/src/utils/suite/metadata.ts](../src/utils/suite/metadata.ts)

## Where data lives in App

Settings related data is defined in [suite/src/reducers/suite/metadataReducer](../src/reducers/suite/metadataReducer.ts) which contains

```
{
 enabled: bool,
 initiating: bool,
 provider: {
   type: "dropbox" | "google",
   token: string,
   user: string
 }
}
```

Metadata itself is divided into 2 groups (device metadata and account metadata). They are stored together with concrete records.

Device has metadata property:

```
{
  /*
   - disabled is initial state. user has not interacted with metadata before, metadata keys are not available
   - enabled means that metadata is enabled for this device and application has metadata keys. App will try to download and decipher metadata
   - cancelled means that user rejected cipherKeyValue call on device.
  */
  status: "disabled" |"enabled" | "cancelled",
  key: string,
  fileName: string,
  aesKey: string,
  walletLabel: string
}

```

Account has metadata property which is an object of following shape:

```
{
  key: string(xpub),
  fileName: string,
  aesKey: string,
  outputLabels: {
    [string(txid)]: {
      [number(outputIndex)]: string
    },
  },
  addressLabels: {
    [string(address)]: string,
  },
  accountLabel: string
}
```

## User stories

### First time user:

1. User opens App for the first time. Metadata is disabled. "Add label" buttons are present on mouse hover over labelable data.
1. User clicks "Add label" button.
1. Device metadata key is generated.
1. Using device metadata key, account metadata keys are created.
1. Open modal with metadata providers and connect.
1. Fetch data from metadata provider and set interval for fetching data.
1. Activate editable input.

### Metadata enabled during discovery process:

Controlled by `discoveryActions`

1. If passphrase is not used device metadata key is generated before discovery process start. `discoveryActions`
1. If passphrase is used metadata key is generated either:
    - in the middle of the discovery process after successful receiving first bundle of accounts and at least one the account is not empty. `discoveryActions`
    - after passphrase confirmation process. `metadataMiddleware`

## How to turn metadata off

-   controls for common metadata related actions are located in general settings under the labeling section
-   there is a switch which:
    1. sets metadata.enabled bool value
    1. if setting to false, it triggers removal of all metadata (including keys) from devices and accounts.
    1. if setting to false, disconnects metadata provider (Dropbox, Google Drive)
-   there is a button "disconnect provider" which:
    1. triggers removal of all metadata values (**excluding** metadata keys) from devices and accounts. This way provider might be reconnected without reconnecting device
    1. disconnects metadata provider
