# Analytics

Both web and desktop Suite applications collect anonymous data about how a user interacts with them. Analytics is not mandatory and not all users have it enabled, as it can be opt-out during the onboarding process or later in the settings in the general tab. However, by default, it is enabled in the onboarding process and if the user does not opt-out, the application starts to track his interactions immediately after the onboarding process is completed.

## Anonymous data:

Collected data have to be anonymous. This means that Suite should never track any data leaking information about a device or a user.

- device id
- public keys
- transaction id
- ... any other fingerprinting

## Tracking process

Data about interactions are transferred in GET HTTP requests encoded in URI.

Data from **production** builds (codesign branch) are sent to:

- Desktop build: https://data.trezor.io/suite/log/desktop/stable.log
- Web build: https://data.trezor.io/suite/log/web/stable.log
  
Data from **development** builds are sent to:

- Desktop build: https://data.trezor.io/suite/log/desktop/develop.log
- Web build: https://data.trezor.io/suite/log/web/develop.log
  
Data from localhost are not currently tracked anywhere. 

List of available configured endpoints:

    https://data.trezor.io/suite/log    /desktop   /staging     .log
    https://data.trezor.io/suite/log    /desktop   /beta        .log
    https://data.trezor.io/suite/log    /desktop   /develop     .log
    https://data.trezor.io/suite/log    /desktop   /stable      .log
    https://data.trezor.io/suite/log    /web       /staging     .log
    https://data.trezor.io/suite/log    /web       /beta        .log
    https://data.trezor.io/suite/log    /web       /develop     .log
    https://data.trezor.io/suite/log    /web       /stable      .log

Example URI:

`https://data.trezor.io/suite/log/web/stable.log?c_v=1.8&c_type=transport-type&c_commit=4d09d88476dab2e6b2fbfb833b749e9ac62251c2&c_instance_id=qlT0xL2XKV&c_session_id=FZjilOYQic&type=bridge&version=2.0.30`

Which tracks:
```
{
  c_v: '1.9',
  c_type: 'transport-type',
  c_commit: '4d09d88476dab2e6b2fbfb833b749e9ac62251c2',
  c_instance_id: 'qlT0xL2XKV',
  c_session_id: 'FZjilOYQic',
  type: 'bridge',
  version: '2.0.30'
}
```

Attributes which are always tracked:

- **c_v**: version of analytics
- **c_type**: type of tracked event
- **c_commit**: current revision of app
- **c_instance_id**: until user does not wipe storage, the id is still same
- **c_session_id**: id changed on every launch of app
  
Other attributes are connected to a specific type of events.

Specific events can be found in project in [analyticsActions.ts](https://github.com/trezor/trezor-suite/blob/develop/packages/suite/src/actions/suite/analyticsActions.ts) file and also in [company Notion](https://www.notion.so/satoshilabs/Data-analytics-938aeb2e289f4ca18f31b1c02ab782cb) where implemented events with expected attributes and other notes related to analytics can be found.

## Versioning

Whenever there shall be a change in `AnalyticsEvent`, `version` variable in [analyticsActions.ts](https://github.com/trezor/trezor-suite/blob/develop/packages/suite/src/actions/suite/analyticsActions.ts) 
should be bumped. Please follow simple semver versioning in format `<breaking-change>.<analytics-extended>`.
Breaking change should bump major version. Any other change bumps minor version.

## How does analytics work?
1. User with enabled analytics interacts with the application
2. Events are sent to specific endpoints
3. Collected data are parsed and analysed (can be seen in Keboola)
4. Charts and metrics are created (in Tableau)
5. We know how to improve the application

## How to check that events are tracked?

1. **Option**: Open DevTools, navigate to **Network tab**, filter traffic by `.log` and check the **Query String Parameters** section
2. **Option**: Get access to Keboola
3. **Option**: Create a modified build of app with an analytics server URL pointing to your server
4. **Option**: Edit NAT to resolve requests to `https://data.trezor.io/suite/log/web/stable.log` to your local server
