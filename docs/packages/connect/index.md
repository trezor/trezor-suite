# Trezor javascript SDK

There are couple of options how to integrate Trezor devices with your project. This page walks you through
installation and lets you explore SDK API.

## Chose your SDK

Depending on your environment you need to chose the right package.

| package                                                                                                           | environment                       |
| :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------- |
| [@trezor/connect](https://github.com/trezor/trezor-suite/tree/develop/packages/connect)                           | node.js                           |
| [@trezor/connect-web](https://github.com/trezor/trezor-suite/tree/develop/packages/connect-web)                   | web based (DOM required)          |
| [@trezor/connect-webextension](https://github.com/trezor/trezor-suite/tree/develop/packages/connect-webextension) | webextension using service worker |

If you are still unsure which package is the right one you may refer to the following table with a collection of examples.

## Quick start

Import from your selected package

```javascript
// in node
import TrezorConnect from '@trezor/connect';
// or in web based
import TrezorConnect from '@trezor/connect-web';
// or in webextension service worker
import TrezorConnect from '@trezor/connect-webextension';
```

Initialize in project

```javascript
TrezorConnect.init({
    lazyLoad: true, // this param will prevent iframe injection until TrezorConnect.method will be called
    manifest: {
        email: 'developer@xyz.com',
        appUrl: 'http://your.application.com',
    },
});
```

Trezor Connect Manifest requires that you, as a Trezor Connect integrator, share your e-mail and application url with us.
This provides us with the **ability to reach you in case of any required maintenance.**
This subscription is mandatory. Trezor Connect raises an error that reads "Manifest not set" if manifest is not provided. It can be either set via `manifest` method or passed as a param in `init` method.

```javascript
TrezorConnect.manifest({
    email: 'developer@xyz.com',
    appUrl: 'http://your.application.com',
});
```

If you need more customization, refer to [init method documentation](./methods/init.md)

## How it works under the hood

There is a major difference between node.js based package (`@trezor/connect`) and web based packages (`@trezor/connect-web` and `@trezor/connect-webextension`).
In the former the entire SDK logic is a module of the 3rd party application whereas in the latter, there is strict isolation between 3rd party application code and SDK core logic.

### Node.js

In node.js core SDK is loaded as a javascript module without any specificities.

### Web

`@trezor/connect-web` imports only a thin layer with API description into your 3rd party application. When initiated, it injects iframe containing core SDK logic from trezor.io

### Webextension

In case of `@trezor/connect-webextension`, TrezorConnect object is created in a service worker. In this env we can't inject iframe so in order to uphold the same security model as with
`@trezor/connect-wb` we open popup.html and load core SDK logic into it. This however does not build persistent connection between SDK and 3rd party application meaning that events cannot be used.
