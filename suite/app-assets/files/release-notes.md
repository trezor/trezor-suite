### 🚀 New features

- Suite now warns you before you send funds to an address you’ve never transacted with, helping you catch addresses copied from phishing transactions.
- You can now sign Solana v1 format transactions with your Trezor (running firmware 2.13.1 or later).
- The asset screen now charts the asset’s price history, with a range picker from 1D to All.
- The asset screen now has an activity feed showing recent transactions for that asset across every account that holds it.
- Selecting an asset on desktop now opens a new asset screen showing its total balance and fiat value, which network it’s on, and a per-account breakdown.
- The asset table now has a “Show small balances” switch to hide holdings under $1 without changing your portfolio total.
- Home’s asset table now lists one row per asset per network, with tokens as their own rows. Each row shows the price with 7-day change and your balance, and there’s an option to group by network.
- You can now switch the “You pay” and “You get” input fields in the Swap form with a single click. Suite switches the accounts too.
- New “Earning balance” component added to the top of the Earn dashboard.
- Home now shows your NFTs grouped by collection in a new section below your assets.

### 🎨 Improvements

- Added security checks during device setup to help verify packaging and confirm it hasn't been tampered with.
- TRX staking transaction history added to the staking detail screen.
- Earn signing flow improvements on Model One, with the contract address now shown in the first step.
- Tron unstaking counter is now dynamic, instead of showing an approximate fixed value.
- Cardano DRep IDs in the legacy format are now converted automatically to the newer CIP-129 format.
- Zcash transactions now use the standard ZIP 317 fee formula.

### 🔧 Bug fixes

- Stellar transaction signing supports smart contract creation and delegated authorization.
- Signing EIP-712 messages (for example, logging in to OpenSea) with an empty account no longer shows a “minimum balance” warning, since signing a message costs nothing.
- Minor bugs have been resolved, along with general usability enhancements for a more reliable and seamless experience.
