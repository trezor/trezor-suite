# This script is mostly copied from node_modules/react-native/scripts/xcode/find-node-for-xcode.sh
# It was necessary to copy it because the original script was deprecated in favor of manually defining
# you node path in .xcode.env file. This is quite unfortunate because node could be located in many different
# places depends if you use nvm, fnm, nodenv, asdf, volta, etc. So I decided to copy the script and use it
# to setup node env as RN did automatically before.

# Part for "fnm" was modified because it doesn't called "fnm use" before and that caused to fallback default node version

# This script needs to be executed in same pwd where .nvmrc is located.

set -e

#Â WHY WE NEED THIS:
# This script is used to find a valid instance of `node` installed in the machine.
# This script is sourced by other scripts to get access to node.
# Specifically, it is used by the `react-native-xcode.sh` script, invoked by a
# post-build phase in Xcode, to build the js files required by React Native.
#
# DEPRECATION NOTE:
# React Native should not make assumptions on your current node environment.
# This file is deprecated and will be removed in a future release in favor of something
# node-agnostic and configurable by the developers.

# remove global prefix if it's already set
# the running shell process will choose a node binary and a global package directory breaks version managers
