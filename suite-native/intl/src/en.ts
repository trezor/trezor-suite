// Few rules:
// 1. Never use dynamic keys IDs for example: translate(`module.graph.coin.${symbol}`) instead map it to static key: { btc: translate('module.graph.coin.btc') }
// 2. Don't split string because of formatting or nested components use Rich Text Formatting instead https://formatjs.io/docs/react-intl/components#rich-text-formatting
// 3. Always wrap keys per module/screen/feature for example: module.graph.legend

                    answer: 'Portfolio Tracker helps you stay in touch with your portfolio balances without having to connect your Trezor device. Simply sync your coin addresses and you can keep track of your balances on the go. You can also combine coin addresses from multiple wallets or Trezor devices to track your whole portfolio in one place. Connected Trezor allows you to manage your funds associated with your Trezor device. You can verify receive addresses and check your balances and transactions. However, if you disconnect the Trezor, you will no longer see the data from the Trezor device.',
