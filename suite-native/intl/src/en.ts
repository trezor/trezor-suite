// Few rules:
// 1. Never use dynamic keys IDs for example: translate(`module.graph.coin.${symbol}`) instead map it to static key: { btc: translate('module.graph.coin.btc') }
// 2. Don't split string because of formatting or nested components use Rich Text Formatting instead https://formatjs.io/docs/react-intl/components#rich-text-formatting
// 3. Always wrap keys per module/screen/feature for example: module.graph.legend

Connected Trezor allows you to manage your funds associated with your Trezor device. You can verify receive addresses and check your balances and transactions.
