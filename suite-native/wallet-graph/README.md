# @suite-native/wallet-graph

This package should be moved to `@suite-common/wallet-core` later when both graphs (in Suite desktop and the mobile app) are unified to represent the same data.

Then it will be also necessary to move the whole graph functionality (actions, reducer, middleware) from `@trezor/suite` here.
