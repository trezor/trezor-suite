# For suite-dev, the idea behind docker is that we install, build and run dev server for user without any
# dependencies on host (yarn, node). But all source files remain on host. We must ensure that permissions 
# of newly created files in docker (entire monorepo is mounted volume) match users default.
# Otherwise user would run into permission denied problem when trying to rebuild project outside docker.
## Use a proxy or fallback to no proxy at all (direct access to Docker Hub).
