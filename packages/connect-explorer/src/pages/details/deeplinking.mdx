# Deep linking specification

<BetaOnly>

To support connecting to Trezor devices from 3rd party apps on mobile devices, Trezor Suite Lite provides a communication interface via deep linking.

<Callout type="info">
    **This feature is still in beta and is subject to change. It's currently available only in
    development builds of Trezor Suite Lite.**
</Callout>

## Base URL

The base URL for deep linking is different depending on the environment.

| Environment | Base URL                                               |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Production  | currently unavailable                                  |
| Development | `https://dev.suite.sldev.cz/connect/develop/deeplink/` |
| Local       | `trezorsuitelite://connect`                            |

## Query parameters

The method call is specified using the query parameters.

| Parameter  | Type        | Required | Description                                              |
| ---------- | ----------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `method`   | string      | yes      | The name of the Connect method to call (eg. getAddress). |
| `params`   | JSON object | yes      | The parameters for the method call encoded as JSON.      |
| `callback` | string      | yes      | The URL to redirect to after the method call is made.    |

## Callback

To receive the result of the method call, the app must specify a callback URL. The callback URL is called with the result of the method call.

The following query parameters are passed in the callback URL:

| Parameter  | Type        | Description                                                                 |
| ---------- | ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `id`       | integer     | ID of the call                                                              |
| `response` | JSON object | Result of the method call, equivalent to the object returned by the method. |

## Example

Let's imagine we want to convert the following call to a deep link:

```
const address = await TrezorConnect.getAddress({
    coin: 'btc',
    path: "m/44'/0'/0'/0/0",
});
```

The parameters would be:

-   **method**: `getAddress`
-   **params**: `{"coin":"btc","path":"m/44'/0'/0'/0/0"}`
-   **callback**: `https://httpbin.org/get` (as an example)

The encoded deep link URL would then be:

```
trezorsuitelite://connect?method=getAddress&params=%7B%22coin%22%3A%22btc%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22m%2F44%27%2F0%27%2F0%27%2F0%2F0%22%7D&callback=https%3A%2F%2Fhttpbin.org%2Fget
```

When the user returns to the app, the callback URL is called with the result of the method call.
