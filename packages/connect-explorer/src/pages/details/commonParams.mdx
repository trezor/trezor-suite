# Common parameters

Every call requires an `Object` with a combination of common and method-specified fields.
All common parameters are optional.

<Param name="device" type="Object" required={false} />

<div style={{ marginLeft: 30 }}>
    <Param name="path" type="string" required={true}>
        call to a direct device. Useful when working with multiple connected devices. This value is
        emitted by [`TrezorConnectEvent`](./events)
    </Param>
    <Param name="state" type="string" required={false}>
        sets expected state. This value is emitted by [`TrezorConnectEvent`](./events)
    </Param>
    <Param name="instance" type="number" required={false}>
        sets an instance of device. Useful when working with one device and multiple passphrases.
        This value is emitted by [`TrezorConnectEvent`](./events)
    </Param>
</div>

<Param name="useEmptyPassphrase" type="boolean" required={false}>
    metmethod will not ask for a passphrase. Default is set to `false`
</Param>

<Param name="allowSeedlessDevice" type="boolean" required={false}>
    allows to use TrezorConnect methods with device with seedless setup. Default is set to `false`
</Param>

<Param name="keepSession" type="boolean" required={false}>
   Advanced feature. After method return a response device session will NOT! be released. Session should be released after all calls are performed by calling any method with `keepSession` set to false or `undefined`. Useful when you need to do multiple different calls to TrezorConnect API without releasing. Example sequence loop for 10 account should look like:
   
    - `TrezorConnect.getPublicKey({ device: { path: "web01"}, keepSession: true, ...otherParams })` for first account,
    - `Trezor.getAddress({ device: { path: "web01"}, ...otherParams })` for the same account,
    - looking up for balance in external blockchain
    - loop iteration
    - after last iteration call `TrezorConnect.getFeatures({ device: { path: "web01"}, keepSession: false, ...otherParams })`

</Param>

<Param name="useCardanoDerivation" type="boolean" required={false}>
    default is set to `true` for all cardano related methods, otherwise it is set to `false`. 
    This parameter determines whether device should derive cardano seed for current session. Derivation of cardano seed takes longer then it does for other coins. A wallet that works with both cardano and other coins might want to set this param to `true` for every call or it must be able to cope with the following scenario:

    - Connected device is using passhprase
    - Wallet calls `getPublicKey` with `useCardanoDerivation=false`, passhprase is entered, seed derived
    - Wallet calls `cardanoGetPublicKey`.
    - At this moment user will be prompted to enter passhprase again.

</Param>

<Param name="override" type="boolean" required={false}>
    Interrupt previous call, if any.
</Param>

<Param name="chunkify" type="boolean" required={false}>
    determines if address will be displayed in chunks of 4 characters. Default is set to `false`
</Param>
