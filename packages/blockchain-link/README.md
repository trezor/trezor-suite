# @trezor/blockchain-link

blockchain-link is a client and unified interface for several backends (_BE_ further on) of various blockchain networks. Currently, there are implementations for
- [blockbook](https://github.com/trezor/blockbook): BE developed and deployed by SatoshiLabs. Provides access to Bitcoin(like) and Ethereum(like) networks.
- [ripple](https://xrpl.org/): third party BE that provides access to the Ripple network.

## Usage

Add blockchain-link to your dependencies.

```shell
yarn add @trezor/blockchain-link
```

And use it.

```javascript
import BlockchainLink from '@trezor/blockchain-link';

const link = new BlockchainLink({
    name: 'Name used in logs.';
    worker: 'path/to/the/worker.js';
    server: ['url1.of.the.be', 'url2.of.the.be'];
    debug: true;
});

try {
    const resp = link.getInfo();
} catch(error) {

}
```

For complete API see the methods of `BlockchainLink` class in [index.ts](./src/index.ts).

### Workers

Minified workers built for various environments are available in subdirectories of `@trezor/blockchain-link/build/`.

- `module`: Workers wrapped by primitive self-written [webpack plugin](https://github.com/trezor/trezor-suite/blob/develop/packages/blockchain-link/webpack/module-worker-loader.js) into javascript module which can be used as regular module on the main thread. Useful in environments where `Worker` API is not available like `react-native`. See this [webpack config](https://github.com/trezor/trezor-suite/blob/develop/packages/blockchain-link/webpack/workers.module.babel.js) for example integration.
- `web`: Workers for browser based environments. See this [webpack config](https://github.com/trezor/trezor-suite/blob/develop/packages/blockchain-link/webpack/workers.web.babel.js).
- `node`: Workers for node based environments. See this [webpack config](https://github.com/trezor/trezor-suite/blob/develop/packages/blockchain-link/webpack/workers.node.babel.js).

All workers can be also built from source. For example using webpack `worker-loader`:

```
import BlockbookWorker from 'worker-loader?filename=workers/blockbook-worker.[hash].js!@trezor/blockchain-link/lib/workers/blockbook/index.js';
```

## Development

This package provides a simple testing UI for playing around with various implementations and BEs. Run it with

```shell
yarn
yarn dev
```

### Build

```
yarn lint
yarn test
yarn build
```

### Publishing

#### Prerequisites

1. Make sure you have a npm account with write access to `@trezor/blockchain-link` package.
1. Update CHANGELOG.md and list all changes since the last release.
1. Bump the version in `packages/blockchain-link/package.json`. Use the [semver](https://semver.org/) convention.

#### Production

1. `cd packages/blockchain-link` cd into the root of `blockchain-link` package.
1. `yarn build:lib` Build the library.
1. `npm publish` Publish!

#### Beta

If you want to publish to npm as `beta` (from any branch) do the following:

1. `cd packages/blockchain-link` cd into the root of `blockchain-link` package.
1. Change the version in `packages/blockchain-link/package.json` from `X.X.X` to `X.X.(X + 1)-beta.1`.
    The `-beta.<n>` suffix is important because NPM registry doesn't allow overriding already published versions.
    With this suffix we can publish multiple beta versions for a single patch.
1. `yarn build:lib` Build the library.
1. `npm publish --tag beta` Publish!
