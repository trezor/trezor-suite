# Receive

To receive cryptocurrency safely your Trezor wallet, all you need is to generate an address and provide it to whomever is paying you.

While this is easy in theory, there are a number of security and privacy aspects that must be considered, which Trezor Suite helps manage safely.

### How to receive a transaction

1. Open the accounts page and choose the account you wish to receive to, depending on the currency you are receiving. Add a new account if you wish to segregate the incoming transaction from existing funds.
2. Click on Receive.
3. Click Show full address. Full addresses are hidden for privacy purposes.
4. Check the address, character by character, matches the address shown on your Trezor.
5. Click confirm on your Trezor.
6. Click Copy address to automatically copy it to your clipboard, or provide them with a screenshot of the QR code.

Please note: Once you have used a BTC receiving address, it **should not be used again.** Instead, repeat steps 1 to 6 for every new payment coming to your wallet. All addresses generated under one account will ensure the funds are available in the same place, without compromising your privacy unnecessarily.
